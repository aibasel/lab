    # Choose destination for Lab.
    LAB=/path/to/lab
    # Install dependencies.
    sudo apt-get install mercurial python2.7 python-matplotlib python-simplejson
    # Clone Lab repository.
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jendrikseipp/lab ${LAB}

Notes about requirements:

* Lab needs Python 2.7. Python 3 is not supported.
* python-matplotlib is only needed for reports that generate graphs.
* python-simplejson is optional, but makes generating reports much faster.

Add to your ``.bashrc`` to make Lab available on the ``PYTHONPATH``::

    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/lab

Update shell configuration::

    source ~/.bashrc
