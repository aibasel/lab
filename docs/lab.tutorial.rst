Lab tutorial
============

.. note::

    During `ICAPS 2020 <https://icaps20.icaps-conference.org/>`_, we gave
    an `online talk about Lab and Downward Lab
    <https://icaps20subpages.icaps-conference.org/tutorials/evaluating-planners-with-downward-lab/>`_
    (version 6.2). The first half of the presentation shows how to use Lab
    to run experiments for a solver. You can find the recording `here
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39tIUsxbh9w>`_.

Run tutorial experiment
-----------------------
.. highlight:: python

The following script shows a simple experiment that runs a naive vertex
cover solver on a set of benchmarks.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/vertex-cover/exp.py
   :caption:

You can see the available steps with ::

    uv run exp.py

Select steps by name or index::

    uv run exp.py build
    uv run exp.py 2
    uv run exp.py 3 4 5

Find out how to create your own experiments by browsing the `Lab API
<lab.experiment.html>`_.
