"""
Example experiment for running Singularity/Apptainer planner images.

The time and memory limits set with Lab can be circumvented by solvers that fork
child processes. Their resource usage is not checked. If you're running solvers
that don't check their resource usage like Fast Downward, we recommend using
cgroups or the "runsolver" tool to enforce resource limits. Since setting time
limits for solvers with cgroups is difficult, the experiment below uses the
``runsolver`` tool, which has been used in multiple SAT competitions to enforce
resource limits. For the experiment to run, the runsolver binary needs to be on
the PATH. You can obtain a runsolver copy from
https://github.com/jendrikseipp/runsolver.

Since Singularity (and Apptainer) reserve 1-2 GiB of *virtual* memory when
starting the container, we recommend either enforcing a higher virtual memory
limit with ``runsolver`` or limiting RSS memory with ``runsolver`` (like below).
For limiting RSS memory, you can also use `runlim
<https://github.com/arminbiere/runlim>`_, which is more actively maintained than
runsolver.

A note on running Singularity on clusters: reading large Singularity files over
the network is not optimal, so we recommend copying the images to a local
filesystem (e.g., /tmp/) before running experiments.
